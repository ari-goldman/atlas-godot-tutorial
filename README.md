### Play the game at [atlas-godot-tutorial.ari-goldman.xyz](https://atlas-godot-tutorial.ari-goldman.xyz/)

## Info
- Soft gates
	- leveling: enemy spawn rate is no longer tied to enemy player level, so now the player level will only make their time easier, it is not required to progress the game 
	- augments: player can pickup augments dropped that increase their movement speed and fire rate for limited times
- Hard gate: time
	- augments unlock after 20 seconds
	- charging enemies now spawn at 40 seconds in
	- enemy difficulty is tied to time
- Faucets and Sinks:
	- Ammo: the player now spens ammo when they shoot (sink), and they must pickup more around the map (faucet)
	- Physical space: the player now gains more play area as they level up (faucet), but they lose it all when dying (sink?)
	
- Total time:
	- Week 2: ~9 hours
	- Week 3: ~13 hours
